# STARRING WITH THE FIRST STEP

OBJECTIVE

The objective of the first part of the project is:

This is your first task. Forget the API or Docker for now.

- File: A simple Python file (e.g., logic.py).

- Function: Create a single function, let's call it analyze_text(text: str) -> dict.

- Input: This function must accept one argument: a string.

- Output: This function must return a dictionary with three specific keys:

- word_count: An integer for the total number of words.

- character_count: An integer for the total number of characters (including spaces and punctuation).

- average_word_length: A float representing the average length of the words. (A good challenge here: decide how you will - handle punctuation. A simple start is to not remove it.)

- Edge Case: Your function should be able to handle an empty string ("") without crashing (e.g., it should return 0s).
